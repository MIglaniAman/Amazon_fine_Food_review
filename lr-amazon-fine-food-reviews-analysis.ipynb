A rating of 3 can be consider as neutral and can be ignored . This is the approximation and proxy way to approach way of determing the polarity(positivity/negativity) of reviews."

One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!

Canola or rapeseed is not someting a dog would ever find in nature and if it did find rapeseed in nature and eat it, it would poison them. Today's Food industries have convinced the masses that Canola oil is a safe and even better oil than olive or virgin coconut, facts though say otherwise. Until the late 70's it was poisonous until they figured out a way to fix that. I still like it but it could be better.\n",

One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!  I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks.\n",

Canola or rapeseed is not someting a dog would ever find in nature and if it did find rapeseed in nature and eat it, it would poison them. Today's Food industries have convinced the masses that Canola oil is a safe and even better oil than olive or virgin coconut, facts though say otherwise. Until the late 70's it was poisonous until they figured out a way to fix that. I still like it but it could be better.\n",

PERIOD.  No chemicals.  No garbage.Have numerous friends & family members hooked on this stuff.  My husband & son, who do NOT like \"sugar free\" prefer this over major label regular syrup.I use this as my SWEETENER in baking: cheesecakes, white brownies, muffins, pumpkin pies, etc...

The child gets to go through the months of the year and go to wonderful places like Bombay and down the Nile, all the while, eating, well, you know what they get to eat.  Some kids will have Maurice Sendak's version of ice skating or how to treat roses in their heads for a long time and they won't even know where it came from.  Surprise!  It came from this little witty book.  :-)\n",

I love this book because it is a really fun way to learn the months and the poems are very creative. The author's purpose for writing this book was to give children a fun way to learn the months.  The children can also learn things about poetry and rhythm through reading this book.\n",

It's cute and catchy and sounds really childlike but is skillfully written.\n",
